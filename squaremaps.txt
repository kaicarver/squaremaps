I liked a map of the US on the Economist made with a square for each state.

   US states:


   AK                            ME
		  WI          VT NH
   WA ID MT ND MN IL MI    NY MA
   OR NV WY SD IA IN OH PA NJ CT RI
   CA UT CO NE MO KY WV VA MD DE
      AZ NM KS AR TN NC SC DC
	    OK LA MS AL GA
   HI       TX             FL


   (from http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/03/primary-season)

So I tried to make the equivalent for China.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China

   Chinese provinces (needs work):
   

		        HL
		        JL
               NM       LN
         XJ NX SX HE BJ TJ
         QH GS SN HA SD 
      XZ SC CQ HB AH JS SH
	    GZ HN JX ZJ
	    YN GX GD FJ    TW*
		  MC HK
	       HI


   *not part of PRC, included for reference only!

   (made by Kai)

I'd also like to make a version with Chinese characters (to be finished):


   、、、、黑
   、、、、吉
   、蒙、、辽
   新宁晋冀京津 
   青甘 SN HA SD JS SH
   藏川 CQ HB AH ZJ
	    GZ HN JX FJ
	    YN GX GD     臺*
		  澳 港
	       琼


   *not part of PRC, included for reference only!


I also started seeing about making an HTML version: squaremaps.html


Next: Germany has 16 states, France has 18 regions, Russia has 85 federal subjects,
Spain has 17 autonomous communities and 50 provinces, Italy has 20 regions,
Taiwan has 22 divisions, etc...
